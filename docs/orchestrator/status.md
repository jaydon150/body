# Project Status

**Last updated:** 2026-05-11 (late evening, post-P1.06 + ADR 0007)
**Current phase:** Phase 1 in progress. Steps P1.01–P1.06 complete; P1.07 (validate-ontology) ready to dispatch.
**Overall health:** Green

---

## Right now

- Phase 1 steps P1.01–P1.04 **complete**. Real canonical assets now exist:
  - 125-node UBERON-primary skeletal sub-ontology
  - 79 canonical glbs (9.4 MB) in `data/canonical/meshes/uberon_NNNNNNN/lod0.glb`
  - Attribution baked into every glb per ADR 0006 (verified on mandible: `asset.copyright` + `asset.extras.source`)
  - 29 BP3D-side gaps documented (mostly flagship-bone sub-structures — femur head/neck/shaft, phalanges-of-manus/pes)
- Four file-backed Task-subagent dispatches now executed cleanly. ADR 0003 is four-times-proven.
- Paired bones (ribs, vertebrae, carpals, tarsals) handled cleverly: left+right merged at OBJ-text level, preserved as separate glTF mesh nodes for individual runtime selection.

## Active work

- **P1.07 (validate-ontology cross-check) ready to dispatch.** Cross-checks the 79 mesh directories × 3 LODs against the ontology + crosswalk + gap report. Surfaces drift before the registry bakes in P1.08. Independent of Blender.
- **P1.08 (bake-registry) after P1.07.** Walks `data/canonical/meshes/` + ontology to produce the canonical `mesh-asset-manifest.json`. Includes sternum composite synthesis (the P1.04-flagged opportunity).

## Blockers

- None for the orchestrator. P1.02 ready to dispatch on user "go."
- Blender install confirmation still open from user — does not block P1.02 (Anatomy Domain doesn't need Blender). Required ahead of P1.05 (Asset Pipeline cleanup).

## Next milestone

**P1.07 dispatch.** Asset Pipeline + Anatomy Domain cross-check the canonical mesh set against the ontology + P1.01 crosswalk + P1.04 gap report. Surfaces any drift (orphaned glbs, ontology nodes without meshes, broken provenance chains) before P1.08 bakes the registry.

## Upcoming gates (user approval required)

1. **Phase 1 Spec v0.1 approval.** Plus answers to the 7 open questions in the spec.
2. **Phase 1 entry approval per dispatch** (per "approve all" gate). Anticipated batched approval for steps that have no cross-agent dependency.
3. **Phase 1 close** at end of vertical slice.

## Recent decisions

See [decision-log.md](decision-log.md). Latest:

- 2026-05-11 (evening): Phase 0 signed off; ADRs 0004 + 0005 accepted; schemas updated; Phase 1 Spec v0.1 drafted.

## Working assumptions to validate (Phase 1)

- BodyParts3D download URL still accessible — Asset Pipeline's step 3 verifies.
- Blender available on user's machine for headless pipeline runs — open question 4 in Phase 1 Spec.
- Anatomist available for ~50-structure review batch within Phase 1's 8–14 week effort window — open question 5.
- Target hardware: mid-range / 4-year-old laptop, 60 fps stable — open question 6 confirms.

## Pending external inputs

- **User "go" to dispatch P1.02** (Anatomy Domain).
- **Blender install confirmation** — does not block P1.02; required ahead of P1.05.
- **Anatomist reviewer cadence confirmation** — required before P1.16 (review batch).
